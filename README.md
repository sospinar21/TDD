#Sorting Suite

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms. They give us an opportunity to focus on algorithms of various complexity all solving a relatively simple problem.

In this project, you are challenged to implement four fundamental sorting algorithms. Your final submission should include at least these eight files:

##bubbleSort.js
##bubbleSort-test.js
##insertionSort.js
##insertionSort-test.js
##mergeSort.js
##mergeSort-test.js
##quickSort.js
##quickSort-test.js


For your testing start with testing small arrays of numbers and/or letters. For more advanced testing you will need to generate arrays of numbers to see how large of an array your different sorting algorithms can sort.
